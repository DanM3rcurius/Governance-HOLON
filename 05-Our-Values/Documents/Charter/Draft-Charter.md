> Modeling holonic nested heterarchies, we are creating a focused NFT DAO within the Catalyst DAO.  Our hope is the community will see the benefit of building this kind of architecture to focus Cardano NFT efforts and gain explicit experience and speed to market at scale.  

> DAOs have their roots in holonics. By modeling these processes, we will in time become a well-oiled DAO focused on NFTs. We will be learning from Catalyst and hopefully Catalyst will be learning from our experiences as well.

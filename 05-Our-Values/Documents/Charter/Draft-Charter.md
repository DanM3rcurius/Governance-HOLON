# Draft-Charter
Text Length : TBA


## 01 - Introduction - Who We Are/Background ([from the Genesis doc](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/blob/main/13-Our-Appendix/Documents/2021-02-03-Genesis-Document.md))

Relevant quotes :

> Modeling holonic nested heterarchies, we are creating a focused NFT DAO within the Catalyst DAO.  Our hope is the community will see the benefit of building this kind of architecture to focus Cardano NFT efforts and gain explicit experience and speed to market at scale.  

> DAOs have their roots in holonics. By modeling these processes, we will in time become a well-oiled DAO focused on NFTs. We will be learning from Catalyst and hopefully Catalyst will be learning from our experiences as well.


## 02 - Values: collated from the aforementioned docs and grouped under common themes,



## 03 - Community Guidelines: Code of Conduct/Rights/Privileges/Expectations drawn from the Values section that members are expected to adhere to and afford others,

> **Code of Conduct** is separate Open-Source deliverable (See this [Issue](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/4)). I suggest it be only referred to in this Charter (Stephen)

## 04 - Rules of Engagement: pertaining to how holons work and how members can expect to engage within them.

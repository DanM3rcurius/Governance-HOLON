# Welcome to Gov-HOLON GitHub Training

Here we aim to :

* Reduce barriers of entry to GitHub use.
* Encourage participation in NFT-DAO's Governance.
* Collaborate in developing NFT-DAO's Governance.


These materials will iteratively develop in the course of training Gov-HOLON members over the next few weeks.
What works will be kept and refined further.
What does not work will be recorded as a lesson learnt.

# Welcome to Gov-HOLON GitHub Training

## Overview 

Here we aim to :

* Reduce barriers of entry to GitHub use.
* Encourage participation in NFT-DAO's Governance.
* Collaborate in developing NFT-DAO's Governance.


These materials will iteratively develop in the course of training Gov-HOLON members over the next few weeks.
* What works will be kept and refined further.
* What does not work will be recorded as a lesson learnt.

A GitHub Sandbox Organisation is available at https://github.com/Ek-phrasis/. 

Any NFT-DAO HOLON members may request their own repos with Admin rights which they can play with and break.

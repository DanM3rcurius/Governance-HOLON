# Mindfulness Policy

We entertain the idea that this planet is a living organism, a holistic system â€“ made of many decentralised parts - that strives for balance and sustainability from chaos, in order to create symbiotic, more efficient & less intrusive forms of life.

**We value life over profit**
In order to live in harmony with this planet, we will always favour:
* Complementing, over construing, the environment or individuals.
* Building on sovereign grade censorship resistant systems, offering data- & self-sovereignty for good actors. 
* Where possible create a harmonious habitat, blending in and supporting synergies with the environment.
* Preserving, over extracting, resources from the environment or individuals. Growing networks, over enterprises.
* Solutioning, over discussing problems.
* Cooperating, over competing.
* Open source ideas and build loyalty coalitions and teams (infosets/**Holons!**).
* Sustainability over quick profit
* Love, over fear of change.
* Embracing new technologies & fresh thought processes, over conserving faulty systems

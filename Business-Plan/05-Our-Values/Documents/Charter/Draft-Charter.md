# Draft-Charter
Text Length : TBA


## 01 - Introduction - Who We Are/Background

Relevant quotes : `Genesis doc`

> Modeling holonic nested heterarchies, we are creating a focused NFT DAO within the Catalyst DAO.  Our hope is the community will see the benefit of building this kind of architecture to focus Cardano NFT efforts and gain explicit experience and speed to market at scale.  

> DAOs have their roots in holonics. By modeling these processes, we will in time become a well-oiled DAO focused on NFTs. We will be learning from Catalyst and hopefully Catalyst will be learning from our experiences as well.


## 02 - Values: collated from the aforementioned docs and grouped under common themes,

> **Proposals** - `Sample DAO Charter`

> > Every significant action of IDO starts with a “proposal” — the initiation of something that has to be tabled to IDO consideration according to the code rules. Each proposal has the following attributes: description, cost, “contractor(s)”. IDO records metadata into the blockchain that consists anchors and links proving the integrity of the document infinitely. Thus, records are available for transparent public use and cannot be changed. If a proposal receives enough votes to pass then IDO transfers the funds to contractor(s).

> Main Organisational Focus: **Transparency** - `Sample DAO Charter`

> > We differentiate ourselves from both competitors in the industry segment and alternative projects, which target the same potential investors, by providing a framework that is absolutely transparent and invulnerable to any sorts of corporate attacks and internal corruption.

> > Although a complete automation of all processes is impossible, human errors, sabotage, and fraud are minimized as compared to traditionally managed projects.

> **Total Collaboration**  - `The Holonic Enterprise as a Collaborative Information Ecosystem`

> The basic condition for holonic systems is that a holon is simultaneously a “whole” and a “part” of some other whole/holon.


## 03 - Community Guidelines: Code of Conduct/Rights/Privileges/Expectations drawn from the Values section that members are expected to adhere to and afford others,

> **Code of Conduct** is a separate Open-Source deliverable (See this [Issue](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/4)). I suggest it be only refered to in this Charter (Stephen)

> **Triage** `Troy` [Source](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/28#issuecomment-814554494))

> "a process for triaging consensus levels (ie, ratification levels dependent upon holon-levels in the community)" 

## 04 - Rules of Engagement: pertaining to how holons work and how members can expect to engage within them.

> **Contractors** - `Sample DAO Charter`

> > IDO needs “contractors” to accomplish physical tasks such as writing a code, educating a partner or leading the PR activity of IDO project. IDO selects a contractor by accepting a proposal.

> **Peer Facilators / mediators** (between HOLONs) - `The Holonic Enterprise as a Collaborative Information Ecosystem`
> 
> > The mediator will fulfill two main functions. First, it acts as the interface between the agents in the holon and between the agents outside the holon (i.e. acts as a type of facilitator); conceptually, it can be thought of as the agent that represents the holon.
> > 

> **Patterns of Holonic Collaboration** - adapted from - `The Holonic Enterprise as a Collaborative Information Ecosystem`
> * Metamorphic - The overall architecture of the Holonic Enterprise builds on this pattern that replicates at all levels.
> * Dynamic - At all levels of the holonic enterprise, task propagation occurs by a process of virtual cluster (or holarchy) formation
> * Mediator - supporting the decision-making process (between HOLONs)

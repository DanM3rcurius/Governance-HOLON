# Our Mission

NFT-DAO will support a collaborative economy by mobilizing P2P networks and building a composable NFT ‘Shopify’ platform to stimulate user and developer growth on the Cardano blockchain.

## OUR PROBLEM

42 Project Catalyst proposals address NFT point solutions—yet we lack an overarching DApp strategy to dominate as the de facto NFT platform choice. 

## OUR SOLUTION

We will coordinate an NFT-DAO that implements all NFT Dapp requirements to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework on Cardano. 

## OUR CONTEXT

With a community composed of avid Cardano supporters, NFT-DAO has positioned the project within the systematic and research-driven context of the Cardano blockchain project. With Cardano’s Project Catalyst now identified as the largest decentralised fund in the world, the NFT-DAO is also positioned at the forefront of community-driven NFT development within the project. We seek to align our mission with the broader Cardano and Project Catalyst missions, which include principles of code, community and commercialisation

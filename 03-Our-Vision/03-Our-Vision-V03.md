# NFT-DAO VISION STATEMENT

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.
NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.
We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. 

We can build better together.


# HIGH LEVEL CONCEPT

NFT-DAO will support a collaborative culture by mobilizing P2P networks and tokenizing a composable NFT framework to increase socio-economic sovereignty for the Cardano community. The NFT-DAO and NFT BOXCAR will achieve this by focusing on the following three pillars:

## Collaborative Culture (Community) | Mastery
Mobilizing P2P networks to deliver NFT products on Cardano.

## Shared Governance (Code) | Passion
Increasing socio-economic sovereignty for constituents through codified DAO governance. 

## Incentivized Innovation (Commercialization) | Revenue
Tokenizing contributions within a composable NFT Framework on the Cardano blockchain.

It is envisioned that the development of the NFT-DAO as a collaborative culture with shared governance and incentivised innovation embedded, will: 1) provide individuals and communities with greater opportunities to build and launch NFT marketplaces on Cardano; 2) build a dedicated and self-organising community of NFT developers and entrepreneurs within Project Catalyst; 3) refine and leverage collective intelligence as a problem-solving strategy with specific and broad applications – including functionality and interoperability issues cross-chain; 4) contribute to a holistic strategy for multiple NFT use-case deployments; and 5) share governance and contribution equity with participants across the DAO and its contributor network.

The network effect of these outcomes is to increase global socio-economic sovereignty and efficacy.

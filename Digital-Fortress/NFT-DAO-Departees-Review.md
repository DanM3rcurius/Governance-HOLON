#### Intial thoughts 

Quaser convinced me to maintain my faith in Catalyst. This was borne out by the support of the Catalyst Community.

At Townhall, Dor Gorbash and Dabiel Ribar demonstrated their neutrality and provided a means to progress to resolution by public dialogue.

Without adawolf I wouldnâ€™t have taken part in the podcast.

Without all the help  of Rene M, Phil K, [ ... ] I could not have sorted all the questions the community wanted answers to.

Rick McCracken provided a neutral platform where everyone involved could engage in dialogue with full access from the Cardano community.

#### Colleagues

Throughout Dan has been an essential ally, co-worker, and friend. 

I regret that I was not able to pose questions of concern to Anna Maria and Rares of NewMindflow. Without them none of this would have come to light.

I regret that I was not able to pose questions of concern to The Ancient Kraken as he has shown courage and fortitude throughout. And deserves renumeration for his contribution to NFT-DAO.

I hope I was able to pose some questions of concern to Tyler Wales. A dedicated, kind and talented man with many commitments.

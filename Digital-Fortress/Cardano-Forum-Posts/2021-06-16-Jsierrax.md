Stephen_Whitenstall, I hope that Catalyst makes this unfortunate event publicly available ASAP to the whole community, before it leaks and uncontrollable spreads. 
By doing it, validates the Funding system, sets the tone on the level of accountability expected from Fund winners, and the trust they were invested with, when they were awarded the funds. So glad you are here. thank you.

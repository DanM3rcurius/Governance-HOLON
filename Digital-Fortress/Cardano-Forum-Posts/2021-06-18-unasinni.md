“Departing individuals took to public platforms to damage the reputation of the NFT
DAO and those committed to its success—where agreements could not be met on
performance and compensation.”

I’m puzzled about the wording of this and would be happy to get a clarification to prevent misunderstanding:
Since this can be understood as "the departing individuals used public platforms to intentionally damage the NFT-DAO. OR it could be understood as “the departing individuals use of public platforms happened to cause reputational damage to the NFT-DAO”. I think it is critical which of those is meant, or if there is another interpretation that I can’t see myself right now.

Secondly, I’m not clear about the nature of the damaging use of public platforms, did the individuals:

Share confidential data from the NFT-DAO that has the potential to cause reputational damage?

Share personal points of views that have the potential to cause reputational damage?

Share publicly available data in an out of context way, which has the potential to cause reputational damage?

Show publicly available data in proper context which happens to have the potential to cause reputational damage?

Share untrue or false information, giving false statements that have the potential to cause reputational damage?

In short, is there a claim of unfair behavior by the departing individuals and if so, how are those claims based?

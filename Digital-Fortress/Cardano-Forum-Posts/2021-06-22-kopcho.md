NFT-DAO Catalyst Fund-3 Update 2Q21

## Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab 
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088
Proposed by: Rich Kopcho, Finley McIIwaine, Tyler Wailes, Troy Egan

Report compiled by: NFT-DAO

Date: June 17, 2021


## Proposal Vision Statement

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. We can build better together.

## Project Funding

$48,965 Total

In the spirit of Catalyst experiments, we seek to deliver the intention of this funded proposal.

## NFT-DAO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (June 16, 2021)

NFT-DAO is committed to creating the Comprehensive NFT Framework

## NFT-DAO 7 MEMBERS LEFT

In May we identified (16) core members to be rewarded.  

The day before announcing them, (2) left over Occam discussions.  

Then (3) developers and (2) marketing exited. 

## NFT-DAO 5 MEMBER ENTERED

In June (5) new contributors joined.
The (4) remaining developers are also joined by MuKn developers.

## COMMUNICATION FAILURES

Communication issues occurred between teams causing many misunderstandings.

Departing individuals took to public platforms to damage the reputation of the NFT DAO and those committed to its success—where agreements could not be met on performance and compensation.

## COMPENSATION MODEL

A Contribution token was proposed by Rich in March (before funding) to reward and track participation.

It was started, lots of discussions occurred, some iterations, but it never could get consensus on fair measures.


## PAY CORE CONTRIBUTORS 80,000 ADA (RICH’S PROPOSAL)

Hey team.  We identified 16 core contributors the day before the decisions to leave the group.   We aim to reward contributions made, but don't have a model to measure everyone's contributions.  A team wins or loses together. Some are MVPs, some simply add bench depth.

I propose we do the Ticket Sale asap and disperse 16% of the proceeds to each +1 we IDed, 1% each.  If we make $500K that is $80K÷16=$5K each.  This should be incentive enough for each team member to help get through the sale.

Something like this needs to happen.

Troy — 05/27/2021
Sounds good Rich. I'll raise this proposal in the gov meeting.

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

NFT-DAO milestones are based on the successful completion of our MVP. While NFT-DAO consisted of 3 active members at launch and grew to 16 core contributors, some people have left as the scope of NFT-DAO evolved over discussions on early stage implementations and the deliverables were being finalized. Based on the successful completion of milestones is when funds would be distributed to the people involved in the process. A rebooting has occurred and a new Core Cohort is active.

For governance and oversight, payments are voted and determined by the NFT-DAO Core Cohort where Rich is a non-voting member. However Rich does help provide agenda items and initial options for consideration. 

During the first NFT-DAO Core Cohort meeting June 1, 2021, it was decided that Rich would lead business development and that the Ticket Sale app source code would have a third party review in order to determine it is “built, done, and delivered.” The main reason for this is that there was a lack of oversight as to what the developers were building including the libraries. This decision was made with the Developer Lead. (5 - Yes, 0 - no, 1 - abstained). 

Upon review of the source code by MuKn, it was determined that the source code needed to be re-written. Previous discussions were held with the original developers to compensate them for their time, however no agreement was reached due to differences in opinion on the value of work contributed. 

## Learning

Learning:  As an open-source project, the greatest level of confusion came due to understanding fair compensation. This has been difficult to determine due to the nature of the project. 

Opportunities to create value are not greater than the ability to implement and properly execute. 

Catalyst Proposals begin with an idea, and even with refinement there are many pivots along the way which you gain from experience. 

## HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE

Upon forming the NFT-DAO, we initiated a Core Team of 4 Leaders, Marketing—Tyler, Governance—Troy, Development—Michael, Business—Rich (the title Business wasn’t used until later but was implied).

All global decisions were finalized by the Core Team with inputs from each area.  Local decisions were made in each area.

## HOW COMPENSATION WORKS

We Will Reward Contributors:

It has always been the plan to reward contributions upon completing the project.  This is documented in numerous chat discussions and reports.  We failed to create one clear contract with each member stating this for their specific contributions.  

## The Project Pivoted:

The community chose over time to morph, pivot and stretch the fund-3 goals and deliverables into the Ticket Sale app. While the Governance token morphed into a more immediate Contribution token and way to measure contributions so we could reward people in a fair manner.

## We Can’t Track Contribution Value:

We also did not assign a proper value on any given piece of work before those assignments got started, therefore we cannot say exactly what the tasks are worth.

We do know that the original fund-3 proposal deliverables list was an estimate with no valid reason for the costs we assigned them.  It was NOT what was finally decided to be delivered and the dollars attached to items therein do not reflect the reality of contributed efforts. For instance, Marketing was about $5K, Governance $19K and Development $23K.  These original estimates do not hold.

Nor did we vet individuals as if we were interviewing them for a job, as it was a voluntary community effort. The work distribution was nowhere close to fund-3 proposal and we cannot fairly reward individuals based on that model. Marketing did as much if not more work than Gov and Dev.  

## A Fair Model Proposed:

Under the circumstances we identified an initial 16 core contributors and would distribute rewards evenly. This has been controversial with some as unfair and has therefore stalled. Other contributors question the selection of the 16.  The Leads made the decision who were core contributors.

## A Vote For Effort or Results:
With recent questions on payment for efforts extended vs. final results, NFT-DAO will put the question to a vote on how to pay all contributors; either based on the time worked on the project or completion of the MVP. 


Because we believed we were on track to have a completed Ticket Sale app the end of May, we felt we would be able to reward everyone who was contributing in a more than generous way.  See agenda items.

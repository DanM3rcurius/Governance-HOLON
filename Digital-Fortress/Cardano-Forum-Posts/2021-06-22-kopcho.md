NFT-DAO Catalyst Fund-3 Update 2Q21

## Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab 
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088
Proposed by: Rich Kopcho, Finley McIIwaine, Tyler Wailes, Troy Egan

Report compiled by: NFT-DAO

Date: June 17, 2021


## Proposal Vision Statement

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. We can build better together.

## Project Funding

$48,965 Total

In the spirit of Catalyst experiments, we seek to deliver the intention of this funded proposal.

## NFT-DAO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (June 16, 2021)

NFT-DAO is committed to creating the Comprehensive NFT Framework

## NFT-DAO 7 MEMBERS LEFT

In May we identified (16) core members to be rewarded.  

The day before announcing them, (2) left over Occam discussions.  

Then (3) developers and (2) marketing exited. 

## NFT-DAO 5 MEMBER ENTERED

In June (5) new contributors joined.
The (4) remaining developers are also joined by MuKn developers.

## COMMUNICATION FAILURES

Communication issues occurred between teams causing many misunderstandings.

Departing individuals took to public platforms to damage the reputation of the NFT DAO and those committed to its success—where agreements could not be met on performance and compensation.

## COMPENSATION MODEL

A Contribution token was proposed by Rich in March (before funding) to reward and track participation.

It was started, lots of discussions occurred, some iterations, but it never could get consensus on fair measures.

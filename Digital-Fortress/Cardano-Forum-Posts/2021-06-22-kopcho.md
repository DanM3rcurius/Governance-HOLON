NFT-DAO Catalyst Fund-3 Update 2Q21

## Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab 
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088
Proposed by: Rich Kopcho, Finley McIIwaine, Tyler Wailes, Troy Egan

Report compiled by: NFT-DAO

Date: June 17, 2021


## Proposal Vision Statement

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.

NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. We can build better together.

## Project Funding

$48,965 Total

In the spirit of Catalyst experiments, we seek to deliver the intention of this funded proposal.

## NFT-DAO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (June 16, 2021)

NFT-DAO is committed to creating the Comprehensive NFT Framework

## NFT-DAO 7 MEMBERS LEFT

In May we identified (16) core members to be rewarded.  

The day before announcing them, (2) left over Occam discussions.  

Then (3) developers and (2) marketing exited. 

## NFT-DAO 5 MEMBER ENTERED

In June (5) new contributors joined.
The (4) remaining developers are also joined by MuKn developers.

## COMMUNICATION FAILURES

Communication issues occurred between teams causing many misunderstandings.

Departing individuals took to public platforms to damage the reputation of the NFT DAO and those committed to its success—where agreements could not be met on performance and compensation.

## COMPENSATION MODEL

A Contribution token was proposed by Rich in March (before funding) to reward and track participation.

It was started, lots of discussions occurred, some iterations, but it never could get consensus on fair measures.


## PAY CORE CONTRIBUTORS 80,000 ADA (RICH’S PROPOSAL)
From: NFT-DAO Core team Discord channel (Members: Troy, Tyler, Michael, Rich)

# RK — 05/27/2021
Hey team.  We identified 16 core contributors the day before the decisions to leave the group.   We aim to reward contributions made, but don't have a model to measure everyone's contributions.  A team wins or loses together. Some are MVPs, some simply add bench depth.

I propose we do the Ticket Sale asap and disperse 16% of the proceeds to each +1 we IDed, 1% each.  If we make $500K that is $80K÷16=$5K each.  This should be incentive enough for each team member to help get through the sale.

Something like this needs to happen.

Troy — 05/27/2021
Sounds good Rich. I'll raise this proposal in the gov meeting.

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

NFT-DAO milestones are based on the successful completion of our MVP. While NFT-DAO consisted of 3 active members at launch and grew to 16 core contributors, some people have left as the scope of NFT-DAO evolved over discussions on early stage implementations and the deliverables were being finalized. Based on the successful completion of milestones is when funds would be distributed to the people involved in the process. A rebooting has occurred and a new Core Cohort is active.

For governance and oversight, payments are voted and determined by the NFT-DAO Core Cohort where Rich is a non-voting member. However Rich does help provide agenda items and initial options for consideration. 

During the first NFT-DAO Core Cohort meeting June 1, 2021, it was decided that Rich would lead business development and that the Ticket Sale app source code would have a third party review in order to determine it is “built, done, and delivered.” The main reason for this is that there was a lack of oversight as to what the developers were building including the libraries. This decision was made with the Developer Lead. (5 - Yes, 0 - no, 1 - abstained). 

Upon review of the source code by MuKn, it was determined that the source code needed to be re-written. Previous discussions were held with the original developers to compensate them for their time, however no agreement was reached due to differences in opinion on the value of work contributed. 

## Learning

Learning:  As an open-source project, the greatest level of confusion came due to understanding fair compensation. This has been difficult to determine due to the nature of the project. 

Opportunities to create value are not greater than the ability to implement and properly execute. 

Catalyst Proposals begin with an idea, and even with refinement there are many pivots along the way which you gain from experience. 

## HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE

Upon forming the NFT-DAO, we initiated a Core Team of 4 Leaders, Marketing—Tyler, Governance—Troy, Development—Michael, Business—Rich (the title Business wasn’t used until later but was implied).

All global decisions were finalized by the Core Team with inputs from each area.  Local decisions were made in each area.

## HOW COMPENSATION WORKS

We Will Reward Contributors:

It has always been the plan to reward contributions upon completing the project.  This is documented in numerous chat discussions and reports.  We failed to create one clear contract with each member stating this for their specific contributions.  

## The Project Pivoted:

The community chose over time to morph, pivot and stretch the fund-3 goals and deliverables into the Ticket Sale app. While the Governance token morphed into a more immediate Contribution token and way to measure contributions so we could reward people in a fair manner.

## We Can’t Track Contribution Value:

We also did not assign a proper value on any given piece of work before those assignments got started, therefore we cannot say exactly what the tasks are worth.

We do know that the original fund-3 proposal deliverables list was an estimate with no valid reason for the costs we assigned them.  It was NOT what was finally decided to be delivered and the dollars attached to items therein do not reflect the reality of contributed efforts. For instance, Marketing was about $5K, Governance $19K and Development $23K.  These original estimates do not hold.

Nor did we vet individuals as if we were interviewing them for a job, as it was a voluntary community effort. The work distribution was nowhere close to fund-3 proposal and we cannot fairly reward individuals based on that model. Marketing did as much if not more work than Gov and Dev.  

## A Fair Model Proposed:

Under the circumstances we identified an initial 16 core contributors and would distribute rewards evenly. This has been controversial with some as unfair and has therefore stalled. Other contributors question the selection of the 16.  The Leads made the decision who were core contributors.

## A Vote For Effort or Results:
With recent questions on payment for efforts extended vs. final results, NFT-DAO will put the question to a vote on how to pay all contributors; either based on the time worked on the project or completion of the MVP. 


Because we believed we were on track to have a completed Ticket Sale app the end of May, we felt we would be able to reward everyone who was contributing in a more than generous way.  See agenda items.

## TOWN HALL AGENDA May 25th

## REPORT TO CATALYST LEADERSHIP  FUND 3 COHORT

This is the monthly report all funded projects send privately to the Catalyst Leadership Team

Fund_3_-_Cohort_Report_25-5-21.pdf Written by Troy this month.

### A highlight from the report: 

Unfortunately, these team members had not engaged with any other NFT-DAO community  discussions prior to the one week deadline of the "open-source" project MVP, and they were  oblivious to any tokenomics discussions that had been happening. A series of discussions eventuated where the code that had been written would not be released to the community from a private repo  until an agreement had been reached. An offer had been forwarded to the developers with ADA,  native token and equity reward options.

## HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENT EVENTS

At the end of May three developers turned over the Ticket Sales app source code to the NFT-DAO Github repo under open-source Apache License 2.0. 

The code is available to be forked by anyone and can be found here: https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Akkadia  

## Four developers remain.  

Michael Yagi the Dev Lead stepped down from Dev Lead role and remains a contributor.  

## MICHAEL’S DECISION TO STEP DOWN AS LEAD BUT STILL CONTRIBUTE

NFTDAO Core team Discord channel (Members: Troy, Tyler, Michael, Rich)

### YAGI — 06/05/2021

Hey all, I've been giving it a lot of thought, and the role of dev holon lead isn't is a big responsibility that I do not feel I can put in the time to perform at a level I am happy with. In addition, I haven't been able to learn and contribute to the code base in the way that I had hoped. As such, all the permissions have been transferred over and I will be stepping down as the "dev holon lead" and plan on contributing to the opensource repo as an NFT-DAO community member.
RK — 06/05/2021

Hello Michael, I completely understand.  We would love you to continue contributing to the project without having the responsibility of Dev Holon Lead.  Thanks for recognizing the limitations you have personally.  That is the true sign of humility and modesty.  Thank you for all your work.

### Troy — 06/05/2021

Thanks Michael. As an original dev. contributor, your vote will be helpful within the core cohort, if that still works for you?

### YAGI — 06/05/2021

Thank you :). I would love to contribute in anyway I can still. One of the biggest things is I want to focus my time on learning plutus, personal projects, and just time for outside life things again, so I don't plan on attending too many meetings
Good bye NFT-DAO Core chat :wave:


### Larry Beck joined as Tech Lead and will seek a new Dev Lead.

### Tyler Wailes left the NFT-DAO as Marketing Lead, Philip Roberts replaces him.

### tyler.wales — 05/29/2021

Fellas, I have some bad news; this whole thing has become too political.  I have outside family and work obligations that I need to attend to, and will be exiting NFT-DAO.  I will transfer the website and other NFT-DAO related accounts to you over the next several business days.  It was great working with, and getting to know you all.

### RK — 05/29/2021

The nature of working with people is like that.  I am sorry to see you leave.  I wish you the best in your endeavors.

### YAGI — 05/29/2021

Dang. It's been a wild ride, and I'm sad to see you go, but I understand. Thank you for all the long hours and hard work you've put in! I hope to see you around and best of luck

### Artist’s Rares and Annmarie Left the NFT-DAO

Artist’s Rares and Annmarie Left the NFT-DAO and will pursue Trybbles NFTs on a different platform. 
 
# DETAILED UPDATE


## THE EXPERIMENT

The origin of the idea for a Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab is documented in this video: https://youtu.be/tawHSD11ytY It explains that Rich recognized 42 separate proposals might not be funded for the same concept and simply suggested we work together to build one framework.  It makes the point that the idea of a DAO sprang from the community who joined the idea, Rich was not the originator of the idea of a DAO.

Rich wrote the proposal after hearing on Town Hall there was only 5 minutes left to add any proposals to Fund-3.  He quickly added a few place holders, with the intention of participating in the experiment.  He initially asked for $100K as it would require at least that to make this vision happen. He realized from Catalyst community feedback that it was not likely to get funded and there is an unwritten community mental-model to increase your chances of successfully being funded, and it has nothing to do with the real cost of development.  

Rather it is related to the fund size, the competitive landscape and the overall quality of the proposal. It was also clear we’ll need some technical expertise if it was to have a chance of getting funded. To that end we recruited Finley to help and lend his talent to the proposal.  To be clear, Finley is very busy working on his PhD. at UWYO and has not been active in the project.  He agreed to help when smart contracts are available with Plutus and Marlowe.  Thus Finley has had no interaction with the project as yet.



### Learning: There is a model for successful funding of your Catalyst project that could be better documented for the community.

Tyler joined Rich moments before Troy.  Discussions between them is when the idea of a DAO started to take shape.  It seemed like a great idea so we went with it and Tyler and Troy helped massively to finalize the Fund 3 proposal.  Mind you, we didn’t know exactly how we were going execute, we just knew that we would find a way if it got funded.  Thus our initial estimates of what we would deliver are amongst the things that “Differ greatly between iterations”.  As people are assessing our progress, and looking back at the proposal, these specific deliverables don’t account for how the community has reshaped them through iterations.  However, at some point you can’t change the final proposal version, it gets frozen, even if it doesn’t represent what you will eventually pivot to and build.

### Learning: What works to get funding doesn’t necessarily match what is needed to complete the project.

Early on, folks were getting excited about the potential of a DAO, so to level-set and be very clear about our goals, Rich wrote the Genesis document which is posted on our Discord and repeated below.  Bottomline, we are building BOXCAR software as the first priority and allowing a DAO to emerge from the process of working together.

“… while we accomplish our work at hand to deliver the BOXCAR as our first priority, we are growing an NFT DAO from the ground up, learning and training all who join us in the process.”

None of the core proposers believed that on day-one we were magically transformed into a DAO.  It was our aspiration for the long term of what we clearly all understood to be an open source project. 

We were excited to get going and started working on it well before funding, we anticipated it would be rewarding in due time.

### Learning: We should have created clear contracts outlining expectations and deliverables before any work was started.


# GENESIS:

Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab

A Catalyst Fund 3 Proposal

Proposed by: Rich Kopcho

Joined By: Finely McIIwaine, Tyler Wales and Troy Egan

## Link to Catalyst: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/334521-48088?show=comments&comment=338606

Producing WyoHackathon the past three years has brought me into close relationships with the Cardano, IOHK and Emurgo community and teams.  From my history of open-sourcing projects, I noticed a level of professionalism behind the Cardano project that I felt compelled to support more fully at a personal level.  

We submitted WyoHackathon’s IOHK challenges Oct. 2020 through the Catalyst program.  Since I was producing the hackathon I didn’t propose anything until Fund 3.  I wanted to support the model by contributing proposals and learning how the processes and community are operating.  I added several items in the F3 Ideas stage and three final proposals.  Since this proposal under the dApp Creation category resonates with other NFT proposers and is drawing contributors in to help, I’d like to provide a deeper understanding of what we envision.

## VISION

We see the need for a comprehensive framework or scaffolding anyone can build an NFT business opportunity upon. We see Cardano as the rails and we are building a BOXCAR to ride on them that anyone can use to carry their unique product or service (business opportunity) to market.  

## CONSTRUCT

The BOXCAR can be likened to Shopify, the basic ecommerce engine anyone can build a storefront upon.  In our case, an NFT business model. Our goal is to build a composable software framework. One that considers all the elements needed for a full range of NFT business types and accounts for explicitly evaluating all the fundamental requirements of NFT use cases. No small task, but we will build in stages.

This means looking closely at the 42 Catalyst proposals who mention NFTs and determining what the common features and functions are.  It also means we research the dozens of NFT marketplaces, tools and techniques that are operating on other blockchains and determine what are common features and functions in the competitive landscape as well.  Gathering all this information is the initial task we will accomplish.  

Added to that information, we can include the unique opportunities Cardano technology allows us to do that other blockchains can’t.  Combining all of this information into robust requirements will allow us to design an architecture for the BOXCAR that everyone will need to  for building NFT businesses on Cardano expeditiously. We’ll have a very good start for a minimum viable product (MVP).

We already understand certain core services or transactions we will need to build, and engineers are already designing user stories, UML flows and wireframes for reviews and sprints to occur in parallel with the research.

## TRACTION

Others are approaching us based on our project description and some have abandoned their proposals and joined us in collaboration.  

Tyler set aside CineDAO and we added him as a co-proposer.  

Troy had a direct proposal in, and he joined as a co-proposer.

Alessandro had a proposal in the Cardano Forum for a CIP-NFT metadata standard

The SoMint marketing team came over to leverage the collaboration

The Artano proposer reached out to collaborate on the tech to avoid duplication

Wilhelm, a functional programmer who worked on banking SW arrived

Sofi another developer came over

Andrew an artist joined

And the list goes on and on, people see the value of working together

## NFT DAO

As we started to work together several great ideas are emerging amongst the core team of founders.  We have a lot of background in social systems, P2P and holonic architectures. It was natural to start thinking about how we are organized.  The Decentralized Autonomous Organizational (DAO) structures, while not perfect, were presenting several opportunities.

###  Catalyst itself is a DAO

Catalyst itself is a DAO.  Our Collab is meant to gather all the NFT proposals together and save community resources by building the common elements they will all need.  Instead of funding every NFT proposal to create the same thing over and over, we felt we could consolidate the efforts to everyone’s benefit.  Modeling holonic nested heterarchies, we are creating a focused NFT DAO within the Catalyst DAO.  Our hope is the community will see the benefit of building this kind of architecture to focus Cardano NFT efforts and gain explicit experience and speed to market at scale.  

Thus, while we accomplish our work at hand to deliver the BOXCAR as our first priority, we are growing an NFT DAO from the ground up, learning and training all who join us in the process.  This is not the first our team has experienced implementing this kind of structure.  I personally trained thousands of individuals over ten years in holonic systems deployments worldwide. Troy is writing his PhD. thesis on a similar P2P topic.  DAOs have their roots in holonics. By modeling these processes, we will in time become a well-oiled DAO focused on NFTs.  We will be learning from Catalyst and hopefully Catalyst will be learning from our experiences as well.

# HOW
First task is be very clear what our goal is—build the BOXCAR.  

A DAO is simply a means of organizing the work (the O in DAO).  It’s an organizational model.  It provides guidance for who does what, when, how and why through well-established communications and a set of rules or functions.  Thus, our very first task was defining the work to be done and assigning owners. 

There is more to it, like governance, participation, fair contribution reward dispersal and other items that will be worked out as we move forward.  The participation is interesting in a DAO because the A is for autonomous.  It is autonomous yet cooperative behavior that defines participants.  The D is for Decentralized, or no centralized system of control.  We will take the journey together and the DAO will emerge from the work we do.  We will build the canon or rules of engagement as we accomplish our core goal of creating the BOXCAR.

Much like IOHK is slowly releasing Cardano so the community can take it over, we will model similar behavior with NFT DAO.  Also, Catalyst itself is modeling similar behavior as a means to engage the community in self-governance. It will not succeed if we simply ‘will’ it into existence without guidance, nurturing, educating participants and maturing it to be the community’s responsibility.  We have a long-term view of the viability this asset can become for the Cardano community and are wholly committed to seeing it to fruition.

Hopefully this gives you a sense what we aim to accomplish. 

Build the BOXCAR, a composable framework for NFT business models

Allow NFT DAO to emerge for our work and guidance

Your participation and feedback are welcome. 

========== END GENESIS DOC ============================== 

## Catalyst is no longer considered a DAO

After writing this, we were made aware that Catalyst is no longer considered a DAO and is now referred to as an Innovation Fund.  We felt modeling how IOHK is building software, then open-sourcing it to the Cardano Foundation, and how the Catalyst experiment is happening, would be our model to follow and hopefully allow us to expedite our learning process for NFT DAO.   

## Wyoming then wrote legislation for DAO structures

Wyoming then wrote legislation for DAO structures, so we created NFT DAO, LLC for a future organization once the laws became enacted.  That organization has no charter or operating agreement, it is simply a registration as of this date and the DAO laws do not go into effect until July 1, 2021.

## Building BOXCAR is the prime objective because without it, the DAO has no real purpose.

Building BOXCAR is the prime objective because without it, the DAO has no real purpose.  We realized a DAO would need a treasury and some way to generate recurring revenues to sustain it.  Thus even in the proposal we mentioned commercializing the efforts.  Rich took on the responsibility to figure out ways we could build long term value so the DAO could eventually operate as an independent entity and not need to rely on grant funding from Catalyst.  Until that time, we believed we would need a few Catalyst funding rounds in our favor to build what we wanted the community to benefit from.

## frittering away the community’s funds

Knowing we couldn’t get where we needed to be with less than half of what we initially thought we needed, we’ve been very conscious of not frittering away the community’s funds we’ve been granted until being very assured we are going to be able to deliver on our intention of an MVP that demonstrates we are on track to create the product the community got excited for.  Thus, we still have the full dollar value of all the funds granted.  (We spent only some arbitrage on a code quality assessment agreed to by a community vote.)

# THINGS MAY BREAK

“The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men,
Gang aft agley.
An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,
For promis'd joy!  - Robert Burns

This has proved true in our case.  We sought a promised joy, a lively environment of working collaboratively together to build a framework for NFTs the whole community could use.  Not focusing on immediate returns, nor expecting grief and pain.  But perhaps that was not true for all who joined, they may have had expectations they didn’t make us aware of, like wanting to be paid immediately.  As some time went on, we started to hear about them, some wanted to obtain governance tokens, some might have wanted to be paid immediately for their contributions.  As this occurred I proposed a Contribution token as Governance tokens were not going to happen any time soon.  Work on it started in the Governance team, but was stalled with questions of fairness of different solution models.

## Learning: Clarify all aspects of expectations, even in a community movement, to avoid misunderstandings. Documenting two-way communication is a necessity.

We did attempt to clarify expectations .  We created an AirTable that contributors signed up on.  It has a check box and a free form dialog box where participants signed up to contribute to the project.  https://airtable.com/shrsber2nfjA6PYb0 

## Ready To Build?

By checking this box you grant NFT DAO rights to use creative and intellectual property you share through Discord and all other NFT-DAO related channels of communication. Build better together.

This was important to make clear because NFT-DAO is an open-source project after all and we didn’t want any misunderstandings.

So you received funding from Catalyst and given the way Catalyst works:
Idea submitted, 
refinement
community participation, 
The actual last step was team formation?
ADD LEARNING POINT HERE


## Because the last time he open-sourced a project in 2007, it was built first then released as open-source.

The first week of April, before we were funded, Rich went down the rabbit hole on how to license and copyright an open-source project to make sure contributors understood the implications, and we understood them.  Because the last time he open-sourced a project in 2007, it was built first then released as open-source.  Managing a community contribution was going to be different. A lot of the information led back over 10 years ago where some efforts were made to codify these processes and agreements, but many controversies and different opinions plague the efforts to define a good model.

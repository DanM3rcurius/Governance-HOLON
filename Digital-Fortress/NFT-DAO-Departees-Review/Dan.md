#### Intial thoughts 

Quasar convinced me to maintain my faith in Catalyst. This was borne out by the support of the Catalyst Community.

At Townhall, Dor Gorbash and Daniel Ribar demonstrated their neutrality and provided a means to progress to resolution by public dialogue.

Without Kyle Solomon (adosiawolf) I wouldnâ€™t have taken part in the podcast.

Without all the help  of Rene M, Phil K, [ ... ] I could not have sorted all the questions the community wanted answers to.

Rick McCracken provided a neutral platform where everyone involved could engage in dialogue with full access from the Cardano community.

## OccamFi AMA-Questions

> "OccamFi have agreed to do an AMA (Ask Me Anything) - available Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Which could be hosted on NFT-DAO's YouTube channel. Or we could do it on Discord. We need to organize this and make it happen as part of the discovery process with OccamFi - Tyler" (https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/discussions/87#discussioncomment-743024)

1) Since NFT-DAO is an open-source project and Occam.fi states they have proprietary conditions in their T&Cs [citation needed], how can the DAO ensure that their work will not be monetized by Occam.fi? [I'm not sure if this was what you meant Stephen. Maybe I've worded this wrong, as I'm not sure how we can stop anyone from monetizing what we do. What safeguards can we have in place to protect FOSS?]
2) Since the occam.fi IDO received a backlash from some of the Cardano community (and was accused of lacking transparency and potentially favoring a few buyers), how have you been addressing this backlash?
3) What measures have you put in place to ensure that participants of your launchpad can avoid a similar user experience?
4) As an investor, you appear to be requesting 20% of equity in NFT-DAO, which is a considerable amount for an investment that the DAO can generate through its own product launches. Will you consider lowering your investment share, and will you consider investing in individual products of the DAO rather than in the whole DAO itself?
5) There have been questions raised about Occam.fi having been audited by a company owned by occam.fi [citation needed]. Was this the case? Do you see this as a conflict of interest?
6) You have been looking to port your platform from Ethereum to Cardano. What has this transition been like? What have been some of the challenges?
7) How many people are involved in the operations of Occam.fi?

# Stephen

1 - When will the third party audit of the OccamFi OCC Launch be published ?

2 - Is OccamFi's "IDO Preparation Roadmap" and Due Dilgence process open-source ? 

3 - If OccamFi's "IDO Preparation Roadmap" and Due Dilgence process is open-source - can you provide a repository location ?

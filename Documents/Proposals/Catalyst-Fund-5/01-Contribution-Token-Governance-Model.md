## QA-DAO Contribution :

### Contribution Token model.

NFT-DAO will define a Token Template using InterWorkAlliance's TokenTaxonomyFramework ( https://github.com/InterWorkAlliance/TokenTaxonomyFramework ) that will form the basis for a Contribution Token model. This will provide a functional formula to work from.

### Roadmap : From Audited to Tracked.

#### A) Simple Audited Token (Audited / Fungible)

NFT-DAO will develop a **Simple Audited Token** that will only record an arbirary record of a menbvers contribution. This Token may be held (HODL) as proof of contributon or converted to ADA/Fiat (Fungible).

Following the procedure of the [Cardano Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) GitHub the contribution metadata will be submitted as GitHub pull request to the contribution registry of NFT-DAO with a copy of the JSON file description of the NFT.

#### B) Intermediate Tracked Token (Tracked / Swaps)

NFT-DAO will develop a **Intermediate Tracked Token** that will reference a tracked audit trail of a members contribution (via GitHub or a Kudos system). This Token may be held (HODL) as proof of contributon, onverted to ADA/Fiat (Fungible) or be swapped for other contribution tokens.

Following the procedure of the [Cardano Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) GitHub the contribution metadata will be submitted as GitHub pull request to the contribution registry of NFT-DAO with a copy of the JSON file description of the NFT.

#### C) Complex Voted Token (Voted / Votes)

NFT-DAO will develop a **Complex Voted Token** (voting token) by using a complex set of contracts that depends upon a voting system (Voted) designed using Game Theory which results in the minting of a Token that can be used for participation in governance of a DAO.

Following the procedure of the [Cardano Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) GitHub the contribution metadata will be submitted as GitHub pull request to the contribution registry of NFT-DAO with a copy of the JSON file description of the NFT.

Hey all - I have started building a NFT-DAO Governance repository to FOSS standards on the NFT-DAO Organisation GitHub at https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON - I would encourage anyone in this HOLON who has GitHub experience to 

1) [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), 
2) [raise issues on its content](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
3) close issues.

Even though I am a maintainer I am working from a forked copy myself (this means that every change I make is also recorded and commented) to comly with Open Source standards. My activity can be seen [here](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

I have created a basic projectboard in the repository (https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/projects/1) that can be mirrored in samepage (or anything else). 

At this early stage I have tried to set up the repository as a “back-end” so that DAO members with no experience of GitHub may use other tools to produce content. A key priority is creating contribution guidance and mentorship – see Issue 1 below.

The aim here is to publicly demonstrate that we are beginning to develop the FOSS vision set out in the funding proposal - "We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements ..". Then we can point to this repository in upcoming funding proposal as a live product of our communities effort.

The initial content will be NFT-DAO Goverance HOLON materials that are ready for Open Source review.

There are currently 2 live issues in the repository - 

A **Major Issue** : 1) Build an NFT-DAO Organisation repository that can meet the basic Open Source (FOSS) standard (https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/7) 

and a **Minor Issue** : 2) Review Code of Conduct (https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/issues/4)

I welcome and look forward to any suggestions, amendments, updates, assistance and contributions.

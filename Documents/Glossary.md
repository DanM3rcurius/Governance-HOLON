## Core Cohort
The Core Cohort represents the group of all NFT DAO members who have actively participated in the DAO by contributing their time through various different activities (e.g. software development, governance meetings, etc.).  This differentiates members from those who are passive observers of the NFT DAO's activity (they may participate in conversation on Discord), as they have an interest in the output of NFT DAO.
